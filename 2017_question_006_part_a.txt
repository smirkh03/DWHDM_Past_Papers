6. The A-Priori algorithm is one method used in association rule mining.

(a) Explain what association rule mining is and how confidence and support measures
are defined and used to identify interesting rules

Association rule mining searches for interesting relationships between data items in a set of samples.

The classic application is market basket analysis: find items that are frequently purchased together by a customer.

Not all rules are interesting: for example, they may be based on a statistically insignificant number of occurrences in the set of samples.

Interesting rules may be identified by checking that the rule has some minimum confidence and support.

Given two items A and B, confidence for the rule "items who bought item A also bought item B" (A -> B) is defined as:

(number of transactions containing A and B) / (number of transactions containing A)

Support for the rule A -> B is defined as:

(number of transactions containing A and B) / (total number of transaction)
